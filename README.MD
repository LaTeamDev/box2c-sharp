# Box2D 3.0 for CSharp
A hacked together bindings that feel native to CSharp (or so i tried)

This project consists of 2 parts:
1. Box2D.Interop - Autogenerated Bindings using ClangSharp + some convinience wrappings (e.g. ref instead of pointers)
2. Box2D - cool OOP wrapping of Bindings (You should use it)

You can see this library in action in Box2D.Samples

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If someone knows how to fix my mistakes don't be afraid to pull request!

## What about NuGet?
I will provide this library on a nuget as soon as it will be finished and tested (at least a bit). Could it be a Unit
Test or a Battle Test in a real product, it does not matter
